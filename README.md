# CrashNitroGolf
Reverse engineering of the shockwave game Crash Nitro Golf

The "main" folder contains the map and slope files required to run the game.

The "test" folder contains assets used to construct the slope files. It seems to use different colors to accomplish collision, slopes, jumps, and out of bounds areas. These files are included for reference and so that custom levels could potentially be made using the assets.
