# CrashNitroGolf
Reverse engineering of the shockwave game Crash Nitro Golf

Folder Contents:

The "main" folder contains the map and slope files required to run the game (map files courtesy of Ryan Silberman and eientei95, from the video)
The "test" folder contains assets used to construct the slope files. It seems to use different colors to accomplish collision, slopes, jumps, and out of bounds areas. These files are included for reference and so that custom levels could potentially be made using the assets.

Instructions before testing:

If you want to test the game and tell me any errors, I highly suggest playing the remake made by Ryan Silberman, located at https://jack-of-all-games.itch.io/crash-nitro-golf, and also watching this video showcasing the original game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFLOYAe6JaI

Insturctions after testing:

Download Fiddler (https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler) and import NitroGolf.farx into it. Use a web browser that supports Shockwave (installer: https://mega.nz/#!B1ITjaDK!7Lq6wICa0Ra7z5GyC0QEEm_jp2FGsgJyOAzbVorjjhY) and go to this link:
